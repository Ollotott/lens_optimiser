# lens_optimiser
WIP, Simulates rays passing through lens using Snell's Law.

The lens being output is a asymmetrical spherical lens, and the algorithm simulates different point that are a set distance away, and then picks the lens version that has the least average standard deviation across these points.

The simulation itself is working, but the optimisation statergy less so.
